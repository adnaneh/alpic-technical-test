# Meet **Socrates**: The Audiobook Companion for Curious Minds 🏛️🎧

You’re on the go — in your car 🚗, on a bike 🚴‍♀️, on a walk 🚶‍♂️.  
You want to learn something 📚, so you open conversational ChatGPT… but the answers feel shallow.  
You’re ready to go deep 🔍, yet you keep getting 30-second surface-level replies.

Socrates blends:  
- The **flexibility** of LLMs 🤖  
- The **depth & structure** of audiobooks 🎧  

This is the future of conversational + audio learning.

## What You Can Do

- 🎯 **Ask about any topic** — Socrates will find the right chapter for you.  
- 💡 **Missed part of the logic?** Ask Socrates to explain the last idea by voice *and* writing.  
- 🧠 **Master what matters** — whether it’s Infrastructure, Fundraising, or Selling, Socrates will play chapters to fill the gaps in your knowledge.

## Why It’s Different

- No more rewinding ⏮️ to “catch that part again”  
- No more vague overviews  
- Just **structured, in-depth learning** that moves with you

**This all starts here.** ✨
